# Welcome

Welcome to the SKill Samurai Prompt Engineering Course
Prompt engineering (PE) is the process of **communicating effectively with an AI to achieve desired results**. As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance rapidly, mastering prompt engineering has become an increasingly valuable and in-demand skill.

This course is tailored to **beginners**, making it the perfect starting point if you're new to AI and PE. However, even if you're not a beginner, you'll still find valuable insights within this course. This course is the **most comprehensive** prompt engineering course available, and the content ranges from an introduction to AI to advanced PE techniques. 


## Philosophy

We believe that students should learn how to use AI ar part of theier education. 




### How you will learn.

Our approach to teaching prompt engineering is guided by the following principles:

**Quick Iterations**â€”Since new PE content is published almost daily, we'll keep this course up-to-date with frequent, concise articles about emerging techniques. 

**Emphasis on Practicality**â€”Our focus is on practical projects that you can immediately use/

**Accessible Examples**â€”To help you grasp the techniques quickly, we'll provide clear, relevant examples throughout the articles.


:::note
This course is under heavy development. We are working hard to improve the learning experience and add more content. If you have any suggestions, please let us know!

## How to read

There's no need to read all chapters in order; feel free to explore what interests you! If you're new to AI, machine learning, and programming, we suggest starting with the [Basics](http://kitsunecode.com/docs/category/-basic-applications) section and the [Instructions](http://kitsunecode.com/docs/basics/intro) guide. For those already familiar with these concepts, the [Intermediate](http://kitsunecode.com/docs/category/%EF%B8%8F-intermediate) section is a great place to dive in and expand your knowledge.

### Article rating system

We've implemented a rating system for articles based on their level of difficulty and the extent of programming knowledge needed:

ðŸŸ¢ Beginner-friendly; no programming required

ðŸŸ¡ Easy; basic programming knowledge necessary, but no specialized expertise

ðŸ”´ Intermediate; programming skills and some domain knowledge required (e.g., calculating logarithmic probabilities)

ðŸŸ£ Advanced; programming expertise and in-depth domain understanding needed (e.g., reinforcement learning techniques)

Please note that even for ðŸ”´ and ðŸŸ£ articles, you can generally grasp the content without prior domain expertise, though it may be helpful for implementation.

### Chapters

Below is a brief overview of each chapter:

**Basics**: Introduction to prompt engineering and fundamental techniques

**Basic Applications**: Simple, practical applications of prompt engineering

**Intermediate**: Research-based PE techniques with moderate complexity

**Applied Prompting**: Comprehensive PE process walkthroughs contributed by community members

**Advanced Applications**: Powerful, and more complex applications of prompt engineering

**Reliability**: Enhancing the reliability of large language models (LLMs)

**Images**: Prompt engineering for text-to-image models, such as DALLE and Stable Diffusion

**Prompt Injection**: Hacking, but for prompt engineering

**Tooling**: A review of various prompt engineering tools and IDEs

**Prompt Tuning**: Refining prompts using gradient-based techniques
